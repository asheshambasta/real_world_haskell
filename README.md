My solutions to [Real World Haskell]'s exercises & meanderings
=====

The meanderings were not part of the book. My day job is that of a Scala programmer, a programming language I like but I'm aware of its shortcomings â€“ the ones in my opinion anyway.
I work as the lead backend engineer/architect at [CentralApp] and I'd love to try out Haskell in our stack sometime soon.

But then again, this isn't a recruitment pitch.

If you find a bug in my code, fire up an issue and I'll try my best to solve it.
